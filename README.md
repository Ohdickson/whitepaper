# Masa Protocol
Soulbound identity infrastructure for building web3 communities

## Abstract
The Masa Protocol addresses the need for a scalable, interoperable, and standardized on-chain identity infrastructure for the rapidly evolving web3 ecosystem. Recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of identity, Masa proposes an open framework with programmable privacy at its core. Utilizing Soulbound Tokens (SBT) as identity primitives, the protocol enables a dynamic representation of an individual's identifiers, encompassing credentials, affiliations, behaviors, reputation, and social roles. 

Masa's decentralized oracle network facilitates cross-chain data interoperability, private data management, governance, and account abstraction. Deployed on five leading EVM-compatible blockchains, the Masa Protocol has generated over 1,200,000 identifiers for more than 500,000 individuals (at the time of publishing), demonstrating the potential of SBTs in establishing identity, provenance, and reputation in web3.
